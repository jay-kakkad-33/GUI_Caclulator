# GUI_Calculator

This is a calculator app which is made using tkinter library of python. I've added the history feature in it that means you can see previous calculations and get them directly on your screen by double clicking the history. All the keys can used from the keyboard as well and there are 2 shortcuts.
- R -> For using root function
- Ctrl + H -> To see history
